						Hi! I am Ross Gongaware, an aspiring web developer residing in the heart of Raleigh, North Carolina.
						Coding has always been a hobby for me allowing me to slowly learn since my first program at age 10. My
						programming range has included projects such as scripting repetitive computing chores, doing various
						small games for my friends to enjoy, and even coding a robot to be controlled autonomously and by user
						control. Web development is an extremely new field of coding for me, but I am learning the tools to
						take my skills to a more professional level.
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently, I work as a coffee roaster for Cup A Joe. This job has trained me to be extremely flexible,
						while having tight time management skills and attention to detail. While I am looking into getting a
						new field of work, the way I have to see the tasks ahead and plan procedures have become useful in
						everything I do.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hobbies of mine include, video gaming, discovering music, going to many concerts, and building and
						playing synthesizers in bands.
